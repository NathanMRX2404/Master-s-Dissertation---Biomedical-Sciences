# Mass Spectrometry Data Cleaning for Improved Identification of Post-Translational Modifications 
## Overview
This GitHub Repository contains all Python and Jupyter notebook files as well as FASTA and search parameter JSON files used for the master's dissertation project "Mass Spectrometry Data Cleaning for Improved Identification of Post-Translational Modifications".
## Datasets
For the initial development of the calibration module, a single .raw file was analyzed for each of the datasets investigated:
- PXD001468:  b1948_293T_proteinID_12B_QE3_122212.raw  (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001468)
- PXD032235:  20210120_HM_HEK_IAA_300minGr_R1.raw      (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD032235)
